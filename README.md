# Description
The is web application project was created to produce an easy online solution for a team to track bugs in their codebase. The project has reached its MVP (minimum viable product) goal of producing a product that can store bug information, such as name, description, resolved status, priority status, date of creation, and if available a screenshot image in a PostgreSQL database. The project was built using Typescript. The front end was built using NextJS, Sass, and TailwindCSS. The back end was built with PrismaJS as the ORM (Object-relational mapping) tool used to communicate with a PostgreSQL database hosted on the Supabase platform. For this application, I took advantage of the NextJS getServerSideProps and API functionality to build the bridge between the client-side and the backend database.

# Goal
- Create a product that can store bugs information for a team
- MVP:
    - Keep track of a bug (bug name, description, resolved status, priority author, images), update or delete bugs if necessary (update and delete action         are only allowed to user privileged).
    - Store and assign new user info and privilege when new successful sign-in has been done through Supabase GitHub Auth.
 
 # Challenges
- Find an ORM tool that will minimize SQL error and abstract the different queries inside the codebase. The ORM has to work with typescript preferably.
- Implement an authentification schema that is secure and reliable.
- Create details forms and correctly pass along the data from said forms.
- Find an effective solution for storing images.
- Change the software theme (light/dark mode) according to the user computer theme.
- Create an application with technologies not used before like typescript, Supabase, and PrismaJS.

# Solution Implemented
- Through my research for an ORM that works with typescript, I found PrismaJS. PrismaJS works especially well due to its fairly minimal initial setup, and the process of setting up the different database tables is especially easy due to its JSON-like formatting for the creation of the various table required for the database.
- For the login and authentification process of the software, I opted to go with a proven authentification solution such as GitHub Auth through the Supabase platform. I chose this solution because Supabase also offered database and file hosting as well which simplified the process of setting up the back end of the bug tracker software
- The forms implementation was especially tricky, I first tried to use react hook state to manage the content of the forms and pass them along to the database but it didnâ€™t behave as expected. After researching for ways to make my forms work, I opted to use the react-hook-form library which fixed my issues of inconsistent data input with my forms.
- The image file storage is done through the Supabase platform.
